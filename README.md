I'm collecting here the various parts of my home automation project

iocontrol

homecontrol

panel

setprofile

plasma-vasttrafikboard
======================

It's a plasma widget to show the incoming public transport, using the
v√§sttrafik API.

Since the code was there for panel, made sense to reuse it in a plasmoid.
